# Known-data logger for iOS (0.2.0)

The iOS version of the known-data logger (KDL): an app for test iPhones that records what a tester
did, so parser authors can check forensic tools against it. The Android version is
[known-data-logger](https://github.com/abrignoni/known-data-logger).

iOS gives apps no way to watch other apps' screens, taps, typed text or notifications. Instead, the
tester runs a screen capture, does each action in its app and marks it (double-tap the back of the
phone), then labels each mark from its screenshot. KDL writes the same rows, hash chain and export
folder as the Android app, and every app switch is logged with the app's bundle id.

The export is checked with the tools in the Android repository, which read both apps' exports:
`tools/make_documentation.py` (spreadsheet, sha256 and hash chain checks), `tools/kdl_check.py`
(grades a LEAPP artifact's output against the export) and `tools/kdl_locate.py`. See
[Checking an export](#checking-an-export).

## Workflow

Once per phone: Setup (scenario id, device label, device snapshot), and Back Tap. Back Tap lists only
the tester's own shortcuts, not the Mark shortcut KDL provides (checked on the test phone), so the
tester first makes a shortcut in Shortcuts > Library > All Shortcuts (+, KDL, Mark; leave Show When
Run on, it shows the banner), then picks it in Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap > Double
Tap. Deleting that shortcut turned Back Tap off. The Setup card gives these steps and a live check
that turns green when a double tap reaches KDL; the check mark is removed with a tombstone.

While a session runs, every app that comes to the front is logged by bundle id, including apps that
are not under test (seen on the test phone), so a tester opens only the apps under test.

Each test:

1. **Session** screen: start screen capture (round button, KDL Screen, Start Broadcast). This
   starts the session.
2. Do each action in its app. When it is done, double-tap the back of the phone. A "Marked" banner
   confirms it; the mark gets a screenshot and the app in front.
3. Stop the capture (round button or the red indicator). This ends the session.
4. **Review** screen, To label: each mark shows its screenshot and app. Pick the action, type the
   text that matters (content, counterpart), Save; the next mark opens. A label's time is the
   mark's, with time quality "after" (the mark comes right after the act).
5. App versions: iOS cannot read another app's version. For built-in Apple apps KDL fills it in
   (below). For any other app, the label form asks for its version once (optional); a row saved
   after that carries it. Review always lists the apps used (tap to check or fix a version or
   name) and says how many still miss a version. Export does not need versions.
6. Export, at the bottom of Review. Saved labels stay under Everything, where they can be changed.

## What it does

- **Session**: start and stop screen capture, with live counts of marks, screenshots and apps.
  "Log something with no screenshot" logs events the screen does not show (a restart, airplane
  mode, a SIM swap, a call while locked), stamped when tapped, plus Start timing / Done for calls
  and recordings.
- **Review**: To label (unlabelled marks and stamped entries, oldest first) and Everything (newest
  first; a labelled mark is shown through its label, app switches read "Switched to Notes").
  Labelling a mark adds an action row at the mark's time that refers to it. Edits add a revision;
  removing adds a tombstone. Tap a screenshot to zoom.
- **Export** (bottom of Review): writes `kdl_<scenario>_<device>_<UTC time>/` with
  `manifest.json`, `actions.jsonl`, `actions.csv` and `screens/` to On My iPhone > KDL > Exports in
  the Files app, and offers the share sheet. Each export is logged as its own row first.
- **Text suggestions**: the label form reads the screenshot's text on the phone (Vision text
  recognition, language correction off) and lists the lines under Content, web addresses first.
  Tapping one fills Content; press and hold to use it as Counterpart. Nothing is filled without a
  tap. On the Mac, the same recognition read the test phone's screenshots in about 0.1 s each after
  a first run of 51 s. On the iPhone 13 the suggestions appeared with no wait the tester could see
  (not timed), the Safari address came first and the note's text came through exactly. On the
  Settings > About screenshot the Mac run read "iOS" as "¡OS", so a suggestion is checked against
  the picture before saving.
- **Setup** (gear on Session; opens by itself until the scenario id and device label are set):
  scenario and device, device snapshots, apps (optional; name, version, account), and
  Diagnostics (clocks, latest row hash).
- **Mark** runs from Back Tap or Shortcuts (with a "Marked" banner), a Home Screen widget, or a
  Control Center or Lock Screen control (iOS 18). Marking from Control Center or the Lock Screen
  puts that overlay in the screenshot; Back Tap does not.
- App names shown for bundle ids come from a small built-in table of Apple apps (display only;
  the log keeps the bundle id). Four of those ids were seen on the test phone; the rest are not
  checked on a device.
- Versions of built-in Apple apps (those in the table) are added to the app list the first time
  capture sees them. Safari gets the iOS version: Apple's Safari 26.6 Release Notes say "Safari 26.6
  is available for iOS 26.6"
  ([source](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-26_6-release-notes));
  that pairing was checked for 26.6 only. No Apple source gives the other built-in apps' versions,
  so they are recorded as "built into iOS <version>". Apple apps that update through the App Store
  (Pages, iMovie) are not in the table and are asked for like any other app. Entries the tester
  made are never changed, and each app is added this way once at most, so one the tester deletes stays
  deleted.

## Screen capture

The tester starts it from the Log tab (Screen capture, round button, KDL Screen, Start Broadcast).
It is a ReplayKit broadcast upload extension, `com.abrignoni.knowndatalogger.broadcast`. iOS shows a
red indicator while it runs.

- It keeps only the latest video frame. Every Mark, from wherever it is tapped, posts a Darwin
  notification; the extension then saves the latest frame as a PNG named after the mark, in the App
  Group `Library/KDL/screens/`, and records its SHA-256 and status (`ok`, `blank` when every sampled
  pixel is near black, or `failed:<reason>`) in the `screenshots` table. The export copies the files
  to `screens/` and checks each hash again, as on Android.
- Each app switch ReplayKit reports becomes an `auto_event` row, action `screen`, with the bundle
  id in `app_package`. ReplayKit does not report the Home Screen.
- While capture runs, a Mark carries the bundle id of the app last reported in front, so a label
  made from it lands on that app's sheet in the spreadsheet.
- Starting the broadcast logs `capture_session_start` and stopping it logs `capture_session_stop`,
  whose detail gives the number of screenshots, failures and app switches, the largest gap between
  a mark and its frame, and the extension's peak memory footprint. If iOS ends the extension without
  telling it, the app logs the stop the next time it is opened and the screen is not being captured
  (`UIScreen.isCaptured`); that path has not been exercised.
- Marking from Control Center or the Lock Screen puts that overlay in the screenshot. Back Tap
  (Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap, set to a Shortcut that runs KDL's Mark) leaves the
  screen alone. Run from Shortcuts or Back Tap, Mark shows a "Marked" banner with the time.

Apple marks the broadcast classes "No longer supported" from iOS 27, where ScreenCaptureKit takes
over. This route was tested on iOS 26.6 only.

## Clocks

Measured on one iPhone 13 with iOS 26.6 (Phase 0, 9 November 2026):

| Field | iOS source |
|---|---|
| `utc_ms`, `tz_id`, `tz_offset_min` | the device clock and time zone, read at each tap |
| `elapsed_ms` | `mach_continuous_time`, which kept counting while the phone slept; `ProcessInfo.systemUptime` did not |
| `boot_count` | always -1. No boot counter was found, and `kern.bootsessionuuid` was refused |
| `network_time_ms`, `gnss_time_ms` | always null; no iOS source |

A restart is logged (`boot_detected`) when time since boot goes backwards. A wall clock move of
more than 2 seconds is logged as `clock_change_detected`; when the move is forward and the new boot
moment is later than the previous row, the detail says a restart would look the same. The detail
also gives how far `kern.boottime` moved, so the two readings can be compared. Whether
`kern.boottime` moves when the clock is set by hand has not been measured.

Ordering: the tools order rows by `(boot_count, elapsed_ms, seq)`. With boot_count -1, rows logged
after a restart sort before earlier ones. Until the tools handle that, read across a
`boot_detected` row in seq order. The manifest's `row_rules` says the same.

Apple's boot-time privacy rule (reason 35F9.1, declared in `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) says boot-time
information may not be sent off the device, except time elapsed between events in the app.
Exporting `elapsed_ms` and `boot_wall_ms` goes past that. Development-signed builds are not
reviewed; this has to be settled before any TestFlight or App Store build.

## Where it keeps the log

`kl.db`, with the Android app's schema 3 ([docs/DATABASE.md](https://github.com/abrignoni/known-data-logger/blob/main/docs/DATABASE.md) in the Android repository), in the App Group container
`group.<prefix>.knowndatalogger`, under `Library/KDL/`, so the widget and controls can write
to it. Journal mode is DELETE. Each write runs in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction that reads the
newest hash and inserts the row, so the app and its extensions never hash over the same previous
row. `actions-live.jsonl` beside it gets every row as it is written. Exports go to the app's own
Documents folder; `xcrun devicectl device copy from` can read that folder but not the App Group.

Ids, from `Config/Signing.xcconfig`: `<prefix>.knowndatalogger` (app), `.widgets` and `.broadcast`
(extensions), and the App Group `group.<prefix>.knowndatalogger`. This repository's prefix is
`com.abrignoni`; a self-built copy uses the tester's own.

## Build it yourself

KDL for iOS is not on the App Store or TestFlight. Each tester builds it from this repository with
their own Apple ID. A free Apple ID works; the build then stops opening after 7 days and has to be
built again.

You need a Mac with Xcode, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install
xcodegen`), an iPhone on iOS 17 or later (screen capture was tested on iOS 26.6), and a USB cable.

1. Clone the repository and open a terminal in its `ios` folder.
2. Copy `Config/Local.example.xcconfig` to `Config/Local.xcconfig` and set your own
   `KDL_ID_PREFIX` (for example `com.yourname`) and `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. App ids are unique across
   Apple accounts, so the prefix cannot be `com.abrignoni`. `Local.xcconfig` is ignored by git.
3. Run `xcodegen generate`, then open `KDL.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
4. In Xcode > Settings > Accounts, add your Apple ID if it is not there.
5. On the iPhone, turn on Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode (the phone restarts), and
   connect it to the Mac.
6. In Xcode, pick your iPhone as the run destination and press Run. Xcode registers the three ids
   (app, widgets, screen capture) and the App Group under your Apple ID.
7. The first time, the iPhone refuses to open KDL until you trust the developer: Settings >
   General > VPN & Device Management > your Apple ID under Developer App > Trust.
8. Open KDL. Setup opens by itself: fill in the scenario id and device label, take a device
   snapshot, and follow the Back Tap card (it turns green when Back Tap reaches KDL).

From the command line, step 6 is:

```bash
xcodebuild -project KDL.xcodeproj -scheme KDL -destination 'id=<iPhone UDID>' -allowProvisioningUpdates build
```

Each part of the app reads its ids from the build settings, so changing the prefix in
`Local.xcconfig` is enough; the export's `logger.package` is then your own app id. With a free
Apple ID, Apple limits how many new app ids an account can register in a week; KDL uses three.

Apple's rule for boot-time information (reason 35F9.1) forbids sending it off the device in apps
that go through App Review. KDL exports time since boot (`elapsed_ms`) and the boot time
(`boot_wall_ms`), the same as the Android app. That is fine for builds made this way, which are not
reviewed, but anyone who ships KDL through the App Store or TestFlight has to change it first.

## Tests

```bash
cd KDLCore && swift test
```

The core reproduces the shared hash test vector (`23843a77…`, the same row as `ChainTest` and
`tools/test_make_documentation.py` in the Android repository; a change to the hashed form must land
in both repositories together), re-verifies the hash chain of an export
(`KDL_ANDROID_EXPORT=<export folder>`; skipped when absent), checks revisions, tombstones, restart
and clock change detection, two writers on one database, and runs `make_documentation.py` on an iOS
export (exit 0, no warnings). That last test looks for the Android repository's `tools` folder in
`KDL_TOOLS`, or in a `known-data-logger` clone beside this one, and is skipped when it finds neither.

## Checking an export

Copy the export folder off the phone (Files app, or `xcrun devicectl device copy from` on the app's
`Documents/Exports`), clone the Android repository, and run:

```bash
python3 known-data-logger/tools/make_documentation.py <export folder> -o documentation.xlsx
```

It exits 1 and prints a WARNING when the sha256 or the hash chain does not check out. To grade a
parser, run iLEAPP on an extraction of the phone (an encrypted backup works for Notes and Safari) and
then `tools/kdl_check.py --export <export folder> --leapp-output <iLEAPP output> --artifact <key>
--package <bundle id> -o check.xlsx`.

## Tested

On one iPhone 13 with iOS 26.6, 9 November 2026, development build, made-up content: setup and a
profile snapshot, an app under test, Start and Stop session, a hand-logged action, Mark and Stamp in
the app, Mark from the Lock Screen Live Activity (removed in 0.2.0; iOS asked once to allow it), the
Control Center control, labelling a mark, an edit, a removal, and an export. The export (13 rows,
built as 1.0 before the version number was fixed) passed `make_documentation.py` (sha256 match,
chain intact, exit 0, no warnings) and the Swift verifier gave the same last hash. Across the
session, `utc_ms - elapsed_ms` stayed within 7 ms. It holds four mark rows: one from the in-app
button and three logged while the Lock Screen and Control Center steps were done. A row does not
say which surface wrote it, so which tap made which row, and whether every tap was logged, is not
established. After reinstalling as 0.1.0, a second export held the same 13 rows byte for byte plus
its own export row, and its last hash matched the one shown on the Setup tab.

Not tried on the phone: the Home Screen widget, the share sheet, a restart,
a clock or time zone change.

Screen capture, same phone, 0.2.0 development build (before the three changes listed below):
Notes, Safari and Settings > About, one Back Tap mark in each. Three marks, three screenshots, each
of the right screen (checked by eye on the phone), hash match at export. Frames were 888 x 1920
pixels (the screen is 1170 x 2532), each within 29 ms of its mark. Peak memory footprint 17 MB. Four
app switches logged (Notes, Safari, Settings, KDL). Back Tap missed some double taps; those made no
row, and nothing on screen said so. That led to the "Marked" banner, the app on the mark, and the
separate capture start and stop rows.

Re-test with those changes: one Back Tap mark in Safari and one in Notes. The banner showed after
each, on the first try. Neither screenshot shows the banner (checked by eye), and each frame was
within 47 ms of its mark. Both marks carried the right bundle id, so the labels landed on the
Safari and Notes sheets with their screenshots linked, and the start and stop rows were listed on
the Scenario sheet. `make_documentation.py` exited 0.

## Not built yet

- Screen capture on iOS 27 (ScreenCaptureKit).
- An ordering fix in the tools for boot_count -1 exports.
- The marks do not record which surface they came from (app, widget, control, Back Tap).
- An iLEAPP module for KDL's own database, and a map of the traces KDL leaves on the phone.
